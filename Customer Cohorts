A customer cohort is a group of customers that share a common characteristic over a certain time period.
For instance, a group of customers that registered in a certain week can be a weekly registration cohort.
Cohorts are often used when creating reports related to customer behavior.
Now, let's take a look at the customer cohorts for a given channel.
A channel defines how we obtained a customer: from social media, via friend referral, etc.

#create a report which will count registration values in annual customer cohorts based on the channel.
The customers table contains the channel ID for each user, but we join it with the channels table to get channel names for the report.
Note that we only show channel names in the report, but we group by both the channel IDs and channel names.

SELECT 
count(customer_id) AS registration_count,
DATE_PART('year', registration_date) AS registration_year,
channel_name
FROM customers cu
JOIN channels ch
ON cu.channel_id = ch.id
GROUP BY DATE_PART('year', registration_date) ,channel_name
ORDER BY DATE_PART('year', registration_date);


#Instead of annual customer cohorts per channel, show weekly customer cohorts per channel in each year.
SELECT 
count(customer_id) AS registration_count,
DATE_PART('year', registration_date) AS registration_year,
channel_name,
DATE_PART('week', registration_date) AS registration_week
FROM customers cu
JOIN channels ch
ON cu.channel_id = ch.id
GROUP BY DATE_PART('year', registration_date) ,channel_name, DATE_PART('week', registration_date)
ORDER BY DATE_PART('year', registration_date), DATE_PART('week', registration_date);



#Create a report to show the weekly counts of registration cohorts in 2017, based on the customer country.
SELECT 
count(customer_id) AS registration_count,
country,
DATE_PART('week', registration_date) AS registration_week
FROM customers
where extract(year FROM registration_date) = 2017
GROUP BY DATE_PART('week', registration_date), country
ORDER BY DATE_PART('week', registration_date);


#No.of Registration in the current year
SELECT 
count(customer_id) AS No_of_registrations
FROM CUSTOMERS
where registration_date >= DATE_TRUNC('year', current_date);


#Create a report showing the weekly counts of registration cohorts in 2017 based on the customer channel.
SELECT 
count(customer_id) AS No_of_registrations,
DATE_PART('week', registration_date) AS registration_week,
channel_name
FROM Customers cu
JOIN channels ch
ON cu.channel_id = ch.id
where extract(year from registration_date) = 2017
GROUP BY DATE_PART('week', registration_date), channel_name
ORDER BY DATE_PART('week', registration_date);


--End of Customer Cohorts
