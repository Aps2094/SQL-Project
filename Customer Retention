//For each weekly registration cohort, we want to see the percentage of customers still active 30, 60, and 90 days after the registration date.
we can analyze a given signup cohort and see what percentage of customers were still active after one, two, or three months.
Customer retention figures will inevitably decrease over time.
Comparing these values can help us determine if our customers are leaving us too quickly.

  #Create a customer retention chart in weekly signup cohorts. It should have the following columns:
year
week
percent_active_10d (the percentage of customers still active 10 days after their registration).
percent_active_30d (the percentage of customers still active 30 days after their registration).
percent_active_60d (the percentage of customers still active 60 days after their registration).
Order the results by year and week.
